My purpose is learning JavaScript and have some fun.

Some code which I wrote in freecodecamp:

`const squareList = arr => {
  // Only change code below this line
  let positiveInteger = arr.filter(elem => {return elem > 0 && Number.isInteger(elem)});
  let newArr = positiveInteger.map( elem => Math.pow(elem,2));

  return newArr;
  // Only change code above this line
};

const squaredIntegers = squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);`
